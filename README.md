# rock-paper-scissors
A JavaScript project to test my skills.

Play a game of rock-paper-scissors against this browser program!

Player will face off agianst the program in 5 rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Upon load/after each round, the program will choose a random value of "rock", "paper", or "scissors". Player will be presented with the same three values in the form of buttons. Once the player has made their choice and clicked a button, the program will compare the player's input with its own decision. The winner will be awarded with a point. After 5 rounds, whoever has the highest score will be declared the winner and the game will end. After the game has ended, a "play again?" button will be displayed that will reset all values, thus restarting the game.
